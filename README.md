# Neighborhood Map
A Single Page WebApp using KnockoutJS to display some of my favorite locations in my neighborhood.  
The locations are saved in a JSON file, which is requested via AJAX and it's loaded into the app.  
The map is being requested and manipulated via [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/), and the information displayed on the markers is comming from [MediaWiki API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)  
You can test it's functionality on this **[Live Demo](https://p3u.github.io/mapp/)** hosted on Github Pages.  
The page was made responsive using Media Queries and calc function in CSS.  
This project was a requisite to the [Full Stack Foundations](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-foundations--ud088) course from Udacity. The course is a requisite for the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.
